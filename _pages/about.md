Hi, nice to meet you!

I am Botao Yu (‰ΩôÂçöÊ∂õ), a Master's student of [Websoft Research Group](http://ws.nju.edu.cn) at [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/7f/6b/c7136a163691/page.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm), advised by Assoc. Prof.  [Wei Hu (ËÉ°‰ºü)](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Wei%20Hu).

I also work with [Xu Tan (Ë∞≠Êó≠)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta), [Peiling Lu (Âç¢‰Ω©Áé≤)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/peil), and [Rui Wang (ÁéãËïä)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ruiwa) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia), and Asst. Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).

My **research interest** includes <u>NLP</u>, <u>AI music</u>, and <u>deep learning</u>. I have experience in information extraction (event extraction, relation extraction), symbolic music generation and understanding, deep learning models (pretrained language models, Transformers, generative models, GNNs, etc.).

üòã I am looking for a PhD position for fall 2023.

[<b>NeurIPS 2022</b>] Museformer: Transformer with Fine- and Coarse-Grained Attention for Music Generation


**Botao Yu**, Peiling Lu, Rui Wang, Wei Hu, Xu Tan, Wei Ye, Shikun Zhang, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu

[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10349/)]     [[Code](https://github.com/microsoft/muzic/tree/main/museformer/)]     [[Demo](https://ai-muzic.github.io/museformer/)]

To solve the long sequence modeling and music structure modeling problem in symbolic music generation, we propose Museformer, a Transformer variant that combines a fine-grained attention for learning the structure-related correlations and a coarse-grained attention for preserving other contextual information at  a low cost.
